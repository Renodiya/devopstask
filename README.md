Learned to host a static website by downloading static web content from site "https://html5up.net/" manually by connecting to EC2 instance using PuTTY (Windows OS).

Tried to create a static website in AWS automatically by using userdata, but it didn't work as expected. Got the default Nginx page on my browser.
Checked the log file to identify the errors and found that the html file was not downloaded at the desired location. Next, downloaded the html file to the location /tmp and unzipped the file. Again found the error message like "This page isnâ€™t working 13.59.203.99 redirected you too many times". Then ended up deleting the index.html in the directory /usr/share/nginx/html/ and it works.
